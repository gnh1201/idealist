My idea list for make new opensource projects

## Why?
These lists are things I can't proceed because I don't have enough financial nuts.

## My idea list
- ts2bat - Convert Javascript/TypeScript to Microsoft Batch File  (Inspired by ts2c)
- ts2bash - Convert Javascript/TypeScript to Bash file (Inspired by ts2c)
